<h2> 🌱 Gentle Task Companion </h2>

Last weekend, I built a small self-care app to support myself during moments of overwhelm.

It’s called **[Gentle Task Companion](https://gentle-task-companion.vercel.app)** — a mental health support tool for neurodivergent people (like me).  
You can track tasks, moods, gratitude, and access simple tools like communication cards and relaxing sounds. It’s private, accessible, and made with care.

🧩 Built with: Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel  
🧪 Try it here: [gentle-task-companion.vercel.app](https://gentle-task-companion.vercel.app)
